To support people suffering from Japan's earthquake, we decide to donate all the net-income of our app [iDaily Pro](http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/idaily-pro/id390691023?mt=8) to Japan Red Cross.

And this is the website we are using to report the progress of the donation. You can see the live version [here](http://app4jp.com). It can also be used as an template for similar needs.

## What's Special?
The cool thing of this template is all functions are implemented through Javascript. That is to say, you don't need a web server with CGI to host it.

Including:

* Read a Twitter stream with #idaily tag, using a Javascript-based template engine: tempo
* Shows sales chart with Google Chart API
* l10n for 4 languages, with support for browser's location hash
